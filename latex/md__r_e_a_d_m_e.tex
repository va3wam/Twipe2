This repository contains all of the information for the next generation of our Two Wheeled Inverted Pendulum robot.

Full details about this project can be read on our \href{https://github.com/va3wam/Twipe2/wiki}{\texttt{ wiki}}.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md77}{}\doxysubsection{Prerequisites}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md77}
The software in this repository was written in the C++ (Arduino) language using Microsoft\textquotesingle{}s Visual Source Code IDE and the library management was handled using the plugin Platform\+IO. As such, source code files have the extension \char`\"{}cpp\char`\"{} denoting c++ rather than the extension \char`\"{}ino\char`\"{} denoting Arduino. ~\newline
\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md78}{}\doxysubsection{Code Compatibility}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md78}
The Arduino C++ code was written to run on the Espressif ESP WROOM32 \char`\"{}\+Software On a Chip\char`\"{} (SOC). The development board used for this SOC is the Adafruit Huzzah32 featherboard. Note that some standard Arduino functions such as Analog\+Write() have not been implemented on the ESP32 SOC and alternate functions such as ledc\+Setup(), ledc\+Attach\+Pin() and ledc\+Write() must be used in their place. There are some additional compatibility issues of note as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The GPIO pin usage is loosey Adafruit featherboard compliant meaning it will work with some boards such as the OLED board
\item This code does not use the Twipe pinout configuration or naming convension so will not port over to a Twipe compliant robot unmodified
\item This code will NOT run on an ESP8266 unmodified because of both GPIO incompatibility as well as some ESP32 specific libraries that are in use
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md79}{}\doxysubsection{Installing}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md79}
